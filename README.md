  ## Description

  This is my professional portfolio. I will do my best to keep this updated with new projects and skills as I finish / acquire them. The motivation was to not only develop an employer-competitive portfolio, but also to enhanced my design skills. I built this project with mostly bootstrap and some custom CSS. I developed the dark-mode switch using JavaScript.  I learned much about bootstrap and how to format and style a professional portfolio.
